/**
 * This class applies a transformation to the input character (a string with a single character):
 *   1. Convert all line endings to Unix-style line endings, i.e. only '\n'.
 *   2. Add a line number at the beginning of each line.
 * Example:
 *   Using this character transformer, the following file :
 *      This is the first line.\r\n
 *      This is the second line.
 *   will be transformed to:
 *      1. This is the first line.\n
 *      2. This is the second line.
